I created a program that u have to guess a secret number between -500 and 500.
This project was a homework from the university, i created it in the first year.
The user has 10 atemps of trying to guess a random number between -500 and 500.
The program will help user to find the secret number telling him if the number he inputed is greater or lesser then the secret number.
If he finds the secret number the program will congratulate him and will stop.
If he doesn't find the secret number in the 10 guesses the program will show him the secret number and will stop.
